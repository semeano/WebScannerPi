WebScannerPi
============

Use an old scanner with your Raspberry Pi and send the scan to your email.



Instructions
============

First of all, make sure that your scanner works with sane. Then, check if you have all these required components installed and configured on your Raspberry Pi:

- sane
- lighttpd
- php5
- mutt


After that, these are steps you have to take:

1. Power on the scanner and connect it to a usb port

2. Check the address of the scanner:

	$ lsusb
	Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9512 Standard Microsystems Corp.
	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
	Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp.
	Bus 001 Device 004: ID 03f0:0405 Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 3400cse (mine was on 004)
	Bus 001 Device 005: ID 059b:0275 Iomega Corp.


3. Give read+write permissions to other users for the usb port where the scanner is:

	$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/001/004


4. Copy the project folder (webscannerpi) to lighttpd default folder, usually on /var/www

5. Change lighttpd folder permissions and owners:

	$ sudo chmod 774 /var/www
	$ sudo chown pi:www-data /var/www


6. Do the same for the project folder, but this time recursively:

	$ sudo chmod 774 -R /var/www/webscannerpi
	$ sudo chown pi:www-data -R /var/www/webscannerpi

This is needed because when you call the script from a webpage (through a shell_exec command) the user who runs it is www-data


7. Add the user www-data to saned group:

	$ sudo usermod -a -G saned www-data



And that's it! If everything is ok (which normally, on the first try, isn't) all you need to do is go to http://‹your_raspberrypi_ip_address›/webscannerpi to test it out!
